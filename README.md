# Hey! I'm Isaac Pruett

**Computer Science** student at **California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo** (Cal Poly SLO).  
Passionate about **robotics**, **real-time embedded systems**, **edge AI**, and **safe high-performance code**.

I build things that move, think, and react — from legged robots and VEXU competition bots to real-time traffic anomaly detection on NVIDIA Jetson hardware.

### Currently Working On
- **BROS** — A lightweight, modern alternative to ROS using **Zenoh** pub/sub + **Nix flakes** for reproducible builds. Built as a part of my work in [PolyUAS](https://polyuas.org).
  → [BROS](https://github.com/Isaac-Pruett/BROS)
- **Cal Poly Gear Slingers VEX U Team** (2025–2026 Season: Push Back)  
  Programming lead — writing performant robot control software in **C++** + embedded firmware in **Rust**.  
  → [2025-2026](https://github.com/CalPolyVEX/2025-2026) Current Season + Rust Firmware · [MonarchBoard](https://github.com/CalPolyVEX/MonarchBoard) (older C++ firmware)

### Other Cool Projects
- **AI-Driven Real-Time Traffic Anomaly Detection**  
  Summer Undergraduate Research Project (SURP 2025) in collaboration with **Caltrans District 5**.  
  Deploying neural networks on **Jetson Orin Nano** for mobile, battery-powered highway monitoring.  
  → [Jetson-RT-Traffic-System](https://github.com/Isaac-Pruett/Jetson-RT-Traffic-System) (Python, DeepStream, ROS 2)

- **Hexapod** — Rust-powered embedded control software for a six-legged walking robot.

### Tech Stack I Love
- **Languages**: Rust · Python · C/C++ · Java 
- **Robotics & Embedded**: ROS 2 · Zenoh · NVIDIA Jetson/DeepStream · VEX SDK · Nix  
- **Tools**: Cargo · uv · Git · Zed · VSCode

Open to collaborations, feedback, or chatting about robotics, embedded Rust, edge AI, or Cal Poly CS life. Feel free to reach out!
